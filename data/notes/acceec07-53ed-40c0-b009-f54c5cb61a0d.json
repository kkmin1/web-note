  "content": "In recent years many companies have successfully utilized  so-called \"multi-level marketing\"  practices. It is important, therefore, to address the differences between a pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing company.  Initially, it should be noted that pyramid schemes always fail, while multi-level  marketing companies sometimes survive.  \n\nWhat Is A Pyramid Scheme?\nA pyramid scheme is a fraudulent system of making money based on recruiting an ever-increasing number of  \"investors.\"  The initial promoters recruit  investors, who in turn recruit more investors, and so on. The scheme is called a \"pyramid\" because at each level, the number of investors increases. The small group of initial promotors at the top require a large base of later investors to support the scheme by providing profits to the earlier investors.\n\n폰지 사기는 일반적으로 투자 관리 서비스로 포장되며, 참여자들은 그들이 얻게 될 수익이 정당한 투자의 결과라고 믿습니다. 사기꾼은 기본적으로 한 명의 자금을 탈취해 다른 이에게 지불합니다.\n다단계 사기는 네트워크 마케팅을 기본으로 하며, 참여자가 돈을 벌기 위해 다른 참여자를 모집하도록 합니다. 참여자들은 다단계의 최상부로 돈을 보내기 전에 커미션을 받습니다.\n\nPyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each person in the pyramid is tasked with bringing in their own subordinates and in turn profiting from their sales or recruitments. This fails because it essentially requires an infinite number of people to join the company. In a Ponzi scheme, however, participants are promised returns on \"investments\", supposedly into stocks or goods, but which are actually paid for by new investors, while a central leading figure takes a portion as profit.",
