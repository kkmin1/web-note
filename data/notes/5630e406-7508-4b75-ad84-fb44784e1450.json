  "content": "The authoritative survey of Leamer and Levinsohn (1995) captures the mid-90’s state of professional thinking: “These estimates of gravity have been both singularly successful and singularly unsuccessful. They have produced some of the clearest and most robust empirical findings in economics. But, paradoxically, they have had virtually\nno effect on the subject of international economics. Textbooks continue to be written and courses designed without any explicit references to distance, but with the very strange implicit assumption that countries are both infinitely far apart and infinitely close, the former referring to factors and the latter to commodities.”",
