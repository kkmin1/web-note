This value can be changed directly from the console to cheat, or it can be modified the old fashioned way with cheat codes. Valid values are:\n0: No cheat. Only level architecture the player has seen is shown.\n1: All architecture is shown, regardless of whether or not the player has seen it. Equivalent to one input of the Doom iddt cheat.\n2: In addition to the previous, shows all things in the map as arrows pointing in the direction they are facing. Equivalent to two inputs of the Doom iddt cheat.\n3: In addition to the previous, all things are wrapped in a box showing their size. There is no iddt cheat for this, as this functionality was added to ZDoom and is not a carryover from vanilla Doom.\n4-6: They are the same as modes 1-3, respectively, except that lines flagged as \"hidden\" are not shown.",
