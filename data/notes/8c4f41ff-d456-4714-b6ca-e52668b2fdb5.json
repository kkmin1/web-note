  "content": "Are magnetic fields generated by rotating electric charges?\n\nEvery time an electric charge moves, a magnetic field is generated. Just as an electric current through a wire creates a magnetic field, so does the rotation and rotation of the nucleus of an atom. Magnetic force lines move around charged particles such as electrons, protons, and ions when they are in motion.\nhttps://byjus.com › question-answer\nHow do moving electric charges create magnetic fields? - Byju's\n\n\nCan a rotating object produce magnetic field?\n\nAs Ampere suggested, a magnetic field is produced whenever an electrical charge is in motion. The spinning and orbiting of the nucleus of an atom produces a magnetic field as does electrical current flowing through a wire. The direction of the spin and orbit determine the direction of the magnetic field.\nhttps://www.nde-ed.org › Magnetism\nCreation of Magnetic Fields - NDE-Ed.org\n\n\nDoes rotation create a magnetic field?\n\nIf you have a rotating electric current, it will create a magnetic field. On Earth, flowing of liquid metal in the outer core of the planet generates electric currents. The rotation of Earth on its axis causes these electric currents to form a magnetic field which extends around the planet.",
